# PIA Proj

This school project was created for the [PIA (Programiranje Internet Aplikacija, en. Internet Application Programming) course][pia], 
which is part of the Master studies at the [School of Electrical Engineering][school], [University of Belgrade][uni].

The project consisted of creating a web application for managing conferences and their agendas, with image galleries and user-to-user messaging.
[Primefaces][primefaces] and [JSF (Java Server Faces)][jsf] were used for the web pages, alongside a [MySQL][mysql] database and [Hibernate ORM][hibernate] for data management.

The project statement in Serbian is given in [2017_IR3PIA - Projekat za junsko-julski rok.pdf][statement] in the `docs` folder. 
The [conferences.sql][dump] in the `data` folder contains a dump of the database used during development and can be used to recreate it.
